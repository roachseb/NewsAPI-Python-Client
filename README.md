# NewsAPI Python Client

## Description

This project provides a Python client for accessing the NewsAPI. It simplifies the process of integrating news search capabilities into your applications. Whether you're building a news aggregation service, a stock trading platform that needs financial news, or a social media app that wants to display relevant news to users, this library is here to assist.

## Features

- Intuitive Python interface for NewsAPI.
- Leverages the `requests` library for HTTP requests.
- Employs an object-oriented model for both requests and responses.
- Supports all parameters of the NewsAPI, including advanced search queries and filtering.
- Designed for flexibility and extensibility, allowing for customization as needed.

## Installation

```bash
pip install newsapi-python-client
```

## Usage

First, you need to initialize the `NewsAPIService` with your NewsAPI key.

```python
import os
from newsApi.service import NewsAPIService  

news_api_service = NewsAPIService(os.environ.get('NEWS_API_KEY'))
```

Then you can use the service to make requests. Here is an example for retrieving news about finance:

```python
from newsApi.models.request import EverythingRequestModel

request_model = EverythingRequestModel(
    q='finance',
)

response = news_api_service.everything(request_model)

for article in response.articles:
    print(f"Title: {article.title}")
    print(f"URL: {article.url}")
    print("---")
```

Note: Remember to replace placeholder values in the `EverythingRequestModel` with actual values.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or later
- `requests` package

## Future Plans

- Enhance error handling and validation.
- Include more examples and use cases.
- Develop comprehensive documentation.
